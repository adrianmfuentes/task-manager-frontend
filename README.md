## 🛠 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

   cd your-repo

   npm install ´´´



2. **🖥 Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can use the following commands:
npm start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.
npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more details, refer to the Create React App Testing Documentation.
npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance. The output is minified, and includes hashed filenames, making it ready for deployment.
For deployment instructions, see the Create React App Deployment Documentation.
npm run eject

⚠️ Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert back.
This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, giving you full control.
You do not need to eject unless you require advanced customizations; the default configuration is suitable for most use cases.
