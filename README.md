# npm run eject
Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert back. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, giving you full control over them.

You do not need to eject unless you require advanced customizations. The default configuration is suitable for most use cases.
